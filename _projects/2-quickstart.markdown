**Description**: This quickstart is the first of two documents that I created for members of the UCLA Language Processing Lab. Lab members use R to analyze their experimental data, but may be unfamiliar with the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed for data science. 

The guide provides readers with the essential information to get started on manipulation data with tidyverse packages. It is followed by the [Practical Tidyverse](/projects/3-practical).

**Tools used**: R, R Markdown
