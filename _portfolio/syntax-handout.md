## Description

I wrote this handout for my Week 9 discussion section as a teaching assistant for UCLA's *Linguistics 20: Introduction to Linguistic Analysis* course in Fall 2019. It's intended to be a review for students who have recently attended lectures on syntactic phrase structure and movement.
