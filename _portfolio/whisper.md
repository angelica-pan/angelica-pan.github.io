## Description

During my time at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) I produced [Gradient Dissent](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gradient-dissent/id1504567418), an interview podcast about machine learning in the real world.

We found that transcribing episodes mattered: adding closed captions to [episode videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD80i8An1OEEb1jP0sjEyiLG8ULRXFob_) increased view time, and being able to create [show notes](https://wandb.ai/fully-connected/podcast) with full transcripts improved discoverability and indexing. Unfortunately, transcribing audio is generally pretty tedious.

As such, I was very excited when OpenAI [released Whisper in September 2022](https://openai.com/research/whisper)! Whisper is an open source, automatic speech recognition deep learning model that transcribes and captions audio/audiovisual files remarkably quickly and well.

Although I ultimately found that Whisper wasn't quite accurate enough, it was still a lot of fun to play around with it! I wrote this guide to document and share my experience with other content creators.
