blurb: A quickstart guide to data manipulation in the tidyverse.
---

## Description

This quickstart is the first of two documents that I created for members of the
UCLA Language Processing Lab. Lab members use R to analyze their experimental data,
but may be unfamiliar with the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed
for data science.

The guide provides readers with the essential information to get started
on data manipulation with tidyverse packages. It's followed by the
[Practical Tidyverse](/portfolio/tidyverse-practical).

## Tools used

R, R Markdown
