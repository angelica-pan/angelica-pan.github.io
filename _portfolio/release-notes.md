## Context

I write and own the release notes for OneStrata, a digital advertising campaign management platform. The monthly release guide keeps internal and external users informed about product updates, and is an important part of our product communications strategy.

## Contribution

Shortly after I wrote the first version of the [OneStrata User Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _portfolio/knowledge-base.md %}), I worked with the product team to create a release note process. My team (Knowledge Management) had developed release note processes for other platforms, but this was our first time doing so with the OneStrata team.

I collaborated closely with product managers to understand their product development lifecycle and create a process that worked with existing timelines, like aligning flag-by deadlines with code freezes. I also defined ticket flagging procedures and intake requirements to ensure that the appropriate context and details is provided from the start, significantly reducing the need for follow-up conversations.

For the release notes, I introduced a release note template that addresses the following key questions in a clear, consistent way:

- **What is it?**: A high-level summary of the feature. Generally includes a comparison of previous and new product behavior, helping users understand what has changed.
- **Where is it?**: Which part of the product is affected; this information is useful to users because OneStrata has a highly nested UI.
- **Do I need to do anything?**: Whether or not the user must take any action to access the feature, since some features are gated and only enabled upon request.

The release note process and template that I created for OneStrata has been recognized and adopted by teams on other platforms for their internal release notes.

For the past 18 releases and counting, I have owned the end-to-end release note process for OneStrata, from ticket intake and stakeholder coordination to writing clear, high-quality release notes and publishing the release guide on time.
