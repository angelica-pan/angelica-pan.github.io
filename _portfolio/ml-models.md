## Description

What actually *is* a machine learning model?

As someone who joined a machine learning (ML) tools company without any prior experience with ML, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this question. So, when I heard that we wanted to write some intro-level, evergreen content on ML models and algorithms, I quickly volunteered.

I worked with subject matter experts and stakeholders to write content that our target audience would find genuinely interesting and valuable, while also hitting all of the search terms that we were targeting. I had a lot of fun figuring out how to balance breadth and depth in one piece!

## Highlights

+ Ranks #5 (with some fluctuation) on Google for the search term "intro to ML models"
