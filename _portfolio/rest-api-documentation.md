## Context

I'm responsible for the reference documentation for FreeWheel's Strata APIs, helping developers integrate quickly and easily with the Strata suite of advertising agency applications.

## Contribution

In early 2025, I led the documentation refresh for two existing Strata REST APIs, auditing and restructuring content to improve clarity and consistency.

As part of the refresh, we migrated the documentation from a manually written PDF to a docs-as-code workflow, where the documentation is generated from source code according to the OpenAPI Specification. By embedding the documentation process more tightly into the development workflow, I helped ensure that the API docs were no longer an afterthought, but a core part of the product experience.

I also advocated for earlier involvement in general of my team (Knowledge Management) in the development cycle. Collaborating with product/engineering earlier, like attending technical reviews, improved the accuracy and efficiency of documentation deliverables, since we were able to get more context and provide feedback faster. 

A few months later, I worked on the documentation for a new API that lets third-party applications integrate directly with OneStrata, Strata's digital campaign management platform. I created the documentation for the Partners API from the ground up, including concept diagrams, authentication guidance, endpoint reference, parameter descriptions, and request/response structures.
