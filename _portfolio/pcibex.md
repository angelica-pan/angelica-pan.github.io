# Description
I'm currently working on a new website for [PCIbex](https://www.pcibex.net/){:target="_blank"}, an open-source online experiment builder. I'm a big fan of PCIbex — I used it to develop experiments when I was the lab manager at the UCLA Processing Lab — and thought it would be a fun project to refactor its documentation.

You can compare [my (in-progress) version]({{site.baseurl}}/pcibex){:target="_blank"} with the [current version](https://www.pcibex.net/documentation/){:target="_blank"}.


**Major changes**
+ Created a new website with permanent navigation sidebar.
+ Reorganized layout to make elements and commands easier to find
+ Created a "Core Concepts" section (reference-based introduction) and the "Basic and Advanced Tutorials" (task-based introduction).
+ Added an ["Internal documentation"]({{site.baseurl}}/pcibex/internal/internal-documentation){:target="_blank"} section for future contributors.

### Tools used
Jekyll, GitHub Pages
