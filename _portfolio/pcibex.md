## Description

I worked on the documentation for 
[PCIbex](https://www.pcibex.net/){:target="_blank"},
an open-source online experiment builder. I'm a big fan of PCIbex — I used it to
develop experiments when I was the lab manager at the UCLA Processing Lab — and
I volunteered to refactor its documentation.

Here's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pcibex" class="say-hello" target="_blank">the version I handed over</a> vs. <a href="https://www.pcibex.net/documentation/" class="say-hello" target="_blank">the original version</a>

## Highlights

+ Designed and developed a new Jekyll and GitHub Pages website to replace
original WordPress website.
+ Redesigned layout to improve navigation.
  + Added sidebar with permanent, easy-to-access links to important sections.
  + Separated sections like "Elements" and "Commands" into different pages to
  reduce information density and increase readability.
  + Designed a
  [new set of element icons]({{site.baseurl}}/pcibex/elements){:target="_blank"}
  to replace the
  [old, visually inconsistent icons](https://www.pcibex.net/reference/){:target="_blank"}.
+ Refactored
[user documentation](https://www.pcibex.net/wiki/00-overview/){:target="_blank"}
into a task-oriented manual
(["Core Concepts"]({{site.baseurl}}/pcibex/core-concepts){:target="_blank"})
and project-based tutorials (["Basic Tutorial"]({{site.baseurl}}/pcibex/basic-tutorial){:target="_blank"}
and
["Advanced Tutorial"]({{site.baseurl}}/pcibex/docs/advanced-tutorial){:target="_blank"}).
+ Wrote [templates](https://github.com/angelica-pan/pcibex/tree/master/_layouts){:target="_blank"}
to keep posts consistent, and to make adding new elements and commands easier.
+ Started an
["Internal documentation"]({{site.baseurl}}/pcibex/internal/internal-documentation){:target="_blank"}
section for future contributors.
+ Found bugs and submitted bug reports when testing beta versions of PCIbex.
