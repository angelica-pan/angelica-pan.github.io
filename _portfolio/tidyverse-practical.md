## Description

This document is the second of two guides that I wrote for members of the UCLA
Language Processing Lab. It follows the
[Tidyverse Quickstart](/portfolio/tidyverse-quickstart),
and provides readers with practical examples of using tidyverse packages and
user-defined functions to analyze a psycholinguistic experiment.
