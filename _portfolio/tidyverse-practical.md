## Description

This document is the second of two guides that I wrote for members of the UCLA Language Processing Lab. It follows the [Tidyverse Quickstart](/projects/2-quickstart), and provides readers with practical examples of using tidyverse packages and user-defined functions to analyze a psycholinguistic experiment. 

## Tools used

R, R Markdown
