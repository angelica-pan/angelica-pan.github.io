## Context

I designed and developed a comprehensive knowledge base for OneStrata, FreeWheel's digital advertising campaign managment platform, from information architecture to project management to writing all content.

## Contribution

I joined the launch team only six weeks before OneStrata was released, so I started by identifying and prioritizing key user workflows. I worked with a team of over 10 product experts to understand user personas and needs, as well as understand the technical details of the platform.

I focused on clarity, accessibility, and scalability:

- **Clarity**: Used technical writing best practices like active voice, clear sentences, tables and lists, and consistent terminology to simplify language. Created conceptual documention and diagrams to explain important terms and processes.
- **Accessibility**: Structured the content to be intuitive and user-friendly by organizing documentation around how users actually interact with the product and UI.
- **Scalablity**: Laid the groundwork for a knowledge base that could grow by implementing a logical information hierarchy, consistent naming schemas, and centralized reference sections that could be cross-linked later on.

By prioritizing core modules, I completed a basic version of the OneStrata User Guide on time, before the official launch of OneStrata in February 2024. This MVP user guide included a quickstart and documented the most important parts of the platform, allowing users to immmediately access and get value from the knowledge base, while creating time to continue building out the documentation.

Since then, I continue to own the documentation strategy and project management of the OneStrata User Guide:

- Ensure that the knowledge base grows with the product: evaluate content gaps, update existing articles as features change, and write new sections for new features.
- Collaborate with product teams on the documentation of new and changed features, including [monthly release notes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _portfolio/release-notes.md %}).
- Use feedback from client-facing teams to make sure that the knowledge base continues to meet the needs of users.
